  Background

  Computational simulation of biological processes can be a
  valuable tool for accelerating biomedical research, but
  usually requires extensive domain knowledge and manual
  adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4
  have proven surprisingly successful for a wide range of
  tasks. This study provides proof-of-concept for the use of
  GPT-4 as a versatile simulator of biological systems.


  Methods

  We introduce SimulateGPT, a proof-of-concept for
  knowledge-driven simulation across levels of biological
  organization through structured prompting of GPT-4. We
  benchmarked our approach against direct GPT-4 inference in
  blinded qualitative evaluations by domain experts in four
  scenarios and in two quantitative scenarios with
  experimental ground truth. The qualitative scenarios
  included mouse experiments with known outcomes and
  treatment decision support in sepsis. The quantitative
  scenarios included prediction of gene essentiality in
  cancer cells and progression-free survival in cancer
  patients.


  Results

  In qualitative experiments, biomedical scientists rated
  SimulateGPT's predictions favorably over direct GPT-4
  inference. In quantitative experiments, SimulateGPT
  substantially improved classification accuracy for
  predicting the essentiality of individual genes and
  increased correlation coefficients and precision in the
  regression task of predicting progression-free survival.


  Conclusion

  This proof-of-concept study suggests that LLMs may enable
  a new class of biomedical simulators. Such text-based
  simulations appear well suited for modeling and
  understanding complex living systems that are difficult to
  describe with physics-based first-principles simulations,
  but for which extensive knowledge is available as written
  text. Finally, we propose several directions for further
  development of LLM-based biomedical simulators, including
  augmentation through web search retrieval, integrated
  mathematical modeling, and fine-tuning on experimental
  data.
